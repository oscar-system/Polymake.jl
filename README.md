# Polymake.jl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/oscar-system/Polymake.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/oscar-system/Polymake.jl)

Julia package for using [`polymake`](https://polymake.org/doku.php), a software for research in polyhedral geometry.
This package is developed as part of the [OSCAR](https://oscar.computeralgebra.de) project.

**Index:**
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Examples](#examples)
* [Polymake syntax translation](#polymake-syntax-translation)
* [Current state](#current-state)

## Installation

The installation can be done in the Julia REPL by first pressing `]` and then
```julia
pkg> add Polymake
```
This will fetch a pre-build binary of `polymake`. You are ready to start `using Polymake`.

### Your own installation of `polymake`

If you already have a recent enough version of `polymake` on your system, you either need to make `polymake-config` available in your `PATH` or the environment variable `POLYMAKE_CONFIG` needs to point to the correct `polymake-config` file.

After this just `add` the package url as above, the build script will use your `polymake` installation.

### `polymake` from source

The current version of `Polymake.jl` relies on an unreleased version of `polymake`. A compatible version is available at [polymake/polymake#snapshots](https://github.com/polymake/polymake/tree/Snapshots).
It can be compiled as follows where `GIT_FOLDER` and `INSTALL_FOLDER` have to be substituted with your favorite folders. Please note that these need to be absolute paths.
Also make sure to check [the necessary dependencies](https://polymake.org/doku.php/howto/install) as well as the [additional instructions for Macs](https://polymake.org/doku.php/howto/mac).

```sh
export POLYMAKE_GIT=GIT_FOLDER
export POLYMAKE_INSTALL=INSTALL_FOLDER
git clone git@github.com:polymake/polymake $POLYMAKE_GIT
cd $POLYMAKE_GIT
git checkout Snapshots
./configure --prefix=$POLYMAKE_INSTALL
ninja -C build/Opt
ninja -C build/Opt install
export POLYMAKE_CONFIG=$POLYMAKE_INSTALL/bin/polymake-config
```
Note that `polymake` might take some time to compile.

After this start `julia` and just `add` the `Polymake.jl` from url as above.

### `Polymake.jl` in a separate environment:
First clone `Polymake.jl`:
```
git clone https://github.com/oscar-system/Polymake.jl.git
```
Then in the same directory start `julia`. In Julia REPL press `]` for `pkg` mode and
```julia
(v1.0) pkg> activate Polymake.jl
(Polymake) pkg> instantiate
(Polymake) pkg> build Polymake # fetches the prebuild polymake binaries
(Polymake) pkg> test Polymake # and You are good to go!
```
If `polymake-config` is in your `PATH`, or `POLYMAKE_CONFIG` environment variable is set the `build` phase will try to use it.

Just remember that You need to `activate Polymake.jl` to use `Polymake`.

## Examples

`polymake` big objects (like `Polytope`, `Cone`, etc) can be created with the `@pm` macro:

```julia
# Call the Polytope constructor
julia> p = @pm Polytope.Polytope(POINTS=[1 -1 -1; 1 1 -1; 1 -1 1; 1 1 1; 1 0 0])
type: Polytope<Rational>

POINTS
1 -1 -1
1 1 -1
1 -1 1
1 1 1
1 0 0

```

Properties of such objects can be accessed by the `.` syntax
```
julia> p.INTERIOR_LATTICE_POINTS
pm::Matrix<pm::Integer>
1 0 0
```

## Polymake syntax translation

The following tables explain by example how to quickly translate `Polymake` syntax to `Polymake.jl`.

### Variables

| Polymake                              | Julia                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$p` (reference to 'scalar' variable) | `p` (reference to any variable)                              |
| `print $p;`                           | `print(p)` or `println(p)` or `@show p`, or just `p` in REPL |
| `$i=5; $j=6;`                         | `i,j = 5,6` or `i=5; j=6`<br> (`;` is needed for separation, can be used to suppress return value in REPL) |
| `$s = $i + $j; print $s;`             | `s = i + j`                                                  |

| `print sort(@A2);`<br>(a copy of `A2` is sorted)       | `println(sort(A2))`<br>(to sort in place use `sort!(A2))`  |
| `$arr = new Array<Int>([3,2,5]);` <br>(a `C++` object) | `arr = [3,2,5]`<br>(the `Int` type is inferred)            |
| `$arr->[0] = 100;`<br>(assignment)                     | `arr[1] = 100`<br>(assignment; returns `100`)              |

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `%h = ();`                     | `h = Dict()`<br>it is **MUCH** better to provide types e.g.<br>`h = Dict{String, Int}()` |
|`$h{"zero"}=0; $h{"four"}=4;`   | `h["zero"] = 0; h["four"] = 4`<br>(call returns the value)|
|`print keys %h;`                | `@show keys(h)` (NOTE: order is not specified)              |
|`print join(", ",keys %hash);`  | `join(keys(h), ", ")`<br>(returns `String`)               |
|`%hash=("one",1,"two",2);`      | `Dict([("one",1), ("two",2)])`<br>(will infer types)      |
|`%hash=("one"=>1,"two"=>2);`    | `Dict("one"=>1,"two"=>2)`                                     |

### Sets

### Big objects & properties:

| Polymake                                                     | Julia                                                         |

### Example script

The following script is modelled on the one from the polymake tutorial:

```julia
using Polymake

str = read("points.demo", String)
matrix_str = "["*replace(replace(str, "\n"=>";"), "/"=>"//")*"]"
matrix = eval(Base.Meta.parse(matrix_str))
@show matrix

p = @pm Polytope.Polytope(:POINTS=>matrix)

@show p.FACETS # polymake matrix of polymake rationals
@show Polymake.Polytope.dim(p) # julias Int64
# note that even in Polymake property DIM is "fake" -- it's actually a function
@show p.VERTEX_SIZES # polymake array of ints

for (i, vsize) in enumerate(p.VERTEX_SIZES)
  if vsize == Polytope.dim(p)
    println("$i : $(p.VERTICES[i,:])")
    # $i will be shifted by one from the polymake version
  end
end

s = [i for (i, vsize) in enumerate(p.VERTEX_SIZES) if vsize == Polytope.dim(p)] # julias vector of Int64s
# note that sets are unordered in julia
unique!(s)

special_points = p.VERTICES[s, :] # julia Matrix of polymake pationals
@show special_points
```

The script included (i.e. in running REPL execute `include("example_script.jl")`) produces the following output:
```
matrix = Rational{Int64}[1//1 0//1 0//1 0//1; 1//1 1//16 1//4 1//16; 1//1 3//8 1//4 1//32; 1//1 1//4 3//8 1//32; 1//1 1//16 1//16 1//4; 1//1 1//32 3//8 1//4; 1//1 1//4 1//16 1//16; 1//1 1//32 1//4 3//8; 1//1 3//8 1//32 1//4; 1//1 1//4 1//32 3//8]
p.FACETS = pm::Matrix<pm::Rational>
21 -32 -32 -32
0 20 8 -7
0 20 -7 8
0 8 20 -7
0 20 -1 -1
0 8 -7 20
3 16 16 -20
0 -1 20 -1
3 16 -20 16
0 -7 20 8
0 -7 8 20
3 -20 16 16
0 -1 -1 20

(Polymake.Polytope).dim(p) = 3
p.VERTEX_SIZES = pm::Array<int>
9 3 4 4 3 4 3 4 4 4
2 : pm_Rational[1, 1/16, 1/4, 1/16]
5 : pm_Rational[1, 1/16, 1/16, 1/4]
7 : pm_Rational[1, 1/4, 1/16, 1/16]
special_points = pm_Rational[1 1/16 1/4 1/16; 1 1/16 1/16 1/4; 1 1/4 1/16 1/16]
3×4 Array{pm_Rational,2}:
 1  1/16   1/4  1/16
 1  1/16  1/16   1/4
 1   1/4  1/16  1/16
```
As can be seen we show `matrix`, `FACETS`, `dim` and `VERTEX_SIZES`.
Then we print rows corresponding to simple vertices and show `special_points`.
The last ouptut is the return of the `include(...)` function (i.e. the last statement in the `example_script.jl`).
To suppress it just execute `include("example_script.jl);`.

#### Notes:

The same minor (up to permutation of rows) could be obtained by using sets, or the identical minor by using (ordered) polymake sets.
Just remember to `collect` the set to a vector when indexing `VERTICES`.
```julia
s = Set(i for (i, vsize) in enumerate(p.VERTEX_SIZES) if vsize == Polymake.Polytopes.DIM(p))
# s is julias set of Int64s

s = pm_Set(i for (i, vsize) in enumerate(p.VERTEX_SIZES) if vsize == Polymake.Polytopes.DIM(p))
# polymake set of longs

special_points = p.VERTICES[collect(s), :]
```


## Current state

### Data structures

* Several small data types from `polymake` are available in `julia`:
    * Integers
    * Rationals
    * Vectors
    * Matrices
    * Arrays
    * Sets
    * some combinations thereof, e.g., Sets of Arrays of Integers

`polymake` data types can be converted to appropriate `julia` types,
but are also subtypes of the corresponding `julia` abstract types, e.g., a
`polymake` array is an `AbstractArray`, and one can call methods that
apply to `AbstractArray`s on `polymake` arrays.

NOTE: if the returned type is a small data type which has not been wrapped in julia yet, you will not be able to access its content or in general use it in any meaningful way, except for passing to `polymake` as an argument of a function.

* Big objects, e.g., Polytopes, can be handled in `julia`.

### Functions

* All user functions from `perl/polymake` are available in the appropriate modules, e.g. `homology` function from `topaz` can be called as `Topaz.homology(...)` in `julia`. We pull the documentation from `perl/polymake` as well, so `?Topaz.homology` (in `julia`s REPL) returns a `perl/polymake` docstring. Note: the syntax presented in the docstring is a `perl/polymake` syntax, not `julia/Polymake` one.
* Most of the user functions from `perl/polymake` are available as `Appname.funcname(...)` in `julia/Polymake`.  However, any function from `polymake` `C++` library can be called via `@pm Appname.funcname(...)` macro . If you happen to use a non-user `perl/polymake` function in REPL quite often you might `Polymake.@register Appname.funcname` so that it becomes available for completion. This is a purely convenience macro, as the effects of `@register` will be lost when `julia` kernel restarts.
* All big objects of `perl/polymake` can be constructed via `@pm` macro. For example
```perl
$obj = new BigObject<Template,Parameters>(args)
```
becomes
```julia
obj = @pm Appname.BigObject{Templete,Parameters}(args)
```
See Section Polymake syntax translation for concrete examples.
* Properties of big objects are accessible by `bigobject.property` syntax (as opposed to `$bigobject->property` in `perl/polymake`). If there is a missing property (e.g. `Polytope.Polytope` does not have `DIM` property in `julia/Polymake`), please check if it can be accessed by `appname.property(object)`. For example property `DIM` is exposed as `Polytope.dim(...)` function.
* Methods are available as functions in the appropriate modules, with the first argument as the object, i.e. `$bigobj->methodname(...)` can be called via `Appname.methodname(bigobj, ...)`
* A function in `julia/Polymake` calling `perl/polymake` may return a big or small object, and the generic return (`PropertyValue`) is transparently converted to one of the data types above. If you really care about performance, this conversion can be deactivated by adding `keep_PropertyValue=false` keyword argument to function/method call.
